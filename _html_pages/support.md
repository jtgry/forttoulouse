### Who are Friends of the Forts?

Friends of the Forts is a non-profit organization that was established in 1985. Our objective is to assist in the preservation of Fort Toulouse - Fort Jackson park as a fun and educational attribute to our community. We work by rallying community and political support to further assist in the growth, development, and maintenance of the park.  Our group also co-sponsors the park's two largest Living History events, the French & Indian War Encampment in April and Alabama Frontier Days in November.

### What is our mission?

* **Promote** - We want to raise public interest in the park. Our goal is for all people within our community to experience the park and the many attributes it has to offer.
* **Educate** - We offer educational programming and living history events to develop an understanding and appreciation for the Forts, and their importance in the development of our community.
* **Support** - We constantly work to improve and further the programs within the park through supporting volunteers, developing new events, and preserving the park grounds
