When the Ministere de la Marine (Ministry of Marine) was organized in 1669, the overseas colonies came under its jurisdiction. A separate establishment of colonial troops, distinct from the marines serving on ships, was created. These were organized as independent companies and paid by the Ministry of Marine (Chartrand, 1984, p.9).

The *Compagnie* is to be well-disciplined and follow the orders of its superiors and field commanders at all times. As a military unit, the members of the *Compagnies Franches De La Marine* are required to maintain uniformity that is easily recognized on the field. While Marines are required to have a full uniform, the officer in charge may decide appropriate attire for off-duty or woods battles at his discretion.

New members are expected to acquire all essential clothing and equipment within one year (two years for the musket). While building their attire, new recruits are to observe existing members and seek guidance from their sponsor. If in doubt, please ask, especially before making large purchases.

Uniforms were issued annually to the company commander. He would then withhold the money from the soldier's pay to cover the cost of the uniforms. One year the marine might receive *le grand habillement* (large clothes) and the next *le petite habillement* (small clothes). The basic daily working uniform would be the small clothes, especially in the frontier post such as Fort Toulouse. The justaucorps was expected to be worn at drill or guard duty if owned by the marine. A breakdown of the uniforms and equipment follows.

**Note:** All marines start at as a *Soldat Recrue* (Soldier Recruit). However, they may be promoted to Fusilier Marine (Marine Fusilier) any time after the six month probationary period. The book, **Fort Toulouse, The French Outpost at the Alabamas on the Coosa** by Daniel H. Thomas, is required reading before receiving any promotion.

## Petite Habillement
****
Once enlisted, recruits of the *Troupes de la Marine* were forwarded to the Isle of Re, near Rochefort, France. There, they boarded the ships bound for the colony to which they were destined. For the voyage, the recruit was issued a frock (with 18 brass buttons), a pair of breeches, a pair of shoes, stockings, a shirt, a wool cap, a comb, a woolen blanket, and a sailor's hammock. (Taken from "Louisiana Recruits 1752-1758" by Winston DeVille.) Remaining clothing and gear was issued upon arrival in the colonies.

List of small clothes or petite habiliment requested for Simon Brignac, a fusilier stationed at Fort Toulouse.

**Le Bonnet (Fatigue cap):** Fatigue cap can either be a knitted red or blue toque, or a blue woolen cap.

**Le Guetres (Gaiters):** Gaiters should be made of heavy white canvas with 16-18 black leather buttons. The top of the gaiters should come to mid-thigh and should be fitted to the leg. The bottom should have a leather or canvas stirrup to hold the gaiter under the foot.

[The Concord or Ligonier from Fugawee are suitable for our portrayal - $100][5]
[Center-seam pucker toe moccasin pattern][6]

At this time the remaining items of clothing, which comprise the full uniform, are considered optional but highly desirable for authentic portrayal.

## Le Grand Habillement
****
**Le Justaucorps (Coat):** The coat is made of natural white wool broadcloth and lined with blue woolen serge . The cuffs are blue wool, The three buttonholes on the cuff are functional, holding the cuff in place when rolled up. The skirts should have functional hooks and eyes for turnbacks. At the top of each side split should be sewn a large button on which the sword belt rests.
[Pattern with extras - $35][7]

**Le Capot (Winter Coat):** Capots were similar to the justaucorps, of unlined wool, well-tailored, with cuffs, a hood. No fringe or capes. The front would be closed with the sword belt or a red or blue wool sash. Colors could be natural white, blue, brown or gray.
[Pattern with extras - $35][7]

**Le Chapeau (Tricorne):** The French tricorn hat was made of black felt and was cocked using hooks and eyes. A black bow - style cockade is on the left side. The hat is trimmed in metallic false gold. This is the standard military hat worn when under arms. _The tricorne is required by the end of the first year._
[French Fusilier Hat - $180][8]

## Accoutrements
****
The common marine was basically armed with a musket, a sword, a bayonet, a cartridge box and sword belt on which to append these items. Once in New France, the sword often remained in garrison and was replaced by a tomahawk or hatchet.

> "The complete equipment for the new companies has arrived. It is being handed over to them as they land. The same practice will be used for the old soldiers, whose guns will be withdrawn. In regard to the clothing, we cannot guess why we are always being with Rochefort in this item. It is, however, essential. We hope, according to what you do us the honor of telling us, that we shall have a supply of everything this year. We have already received a large part of it, and all the soldiers of the garrison both old and new are at present well clothed."
Governor Vaudreuil and Michel to Rouille
Lousiana May 21, 1751
Mississippi Provincial Archives Vol. V : French Dominion, 1749-1763 pg. 87

**Le Fusil (Musket):** From the 1690s to the 1740s the musket carried was predominantly the Marine model made in Tulle. During the 1740s the Ministry of Marine bought the 1728 style muskets from St. Etienne. Acceptable muskets include:

* French Model 1728 Infantry Musket (bright)
* Charleville Model 1763 altered to Model 1728 (bright)
* Tulle Marine (bright)
* Fusil de Chasse (browned or blued)
* Fusil de Grenadier (bright)
* Fusil Fin (browned or blued)
* Type C or D French trade fusil (bright)
* British Trade gun

Muskets that would not have been used and are not acceptable include the Brown Bess, Hudson Bay/Northwest English trade guns, rifles and odd muskets. Those who must purchase a gun needs to acquire one of those from the acceptable list. _The gun is required by the end of the second year._
[Veteran Arms carries the Model 1728 Infantry Musket and the Fusil de Chasse - $600][9]

**Le Ceinturon (Sword Belt):** The sword belt was made of buff leather and always worn with the uniform and will be required, even if you haven't the sword nor bayonet. This belt must have the correct French buckle and may be of the early style for plug bayonet and sword or the later style with the double frog for the sword and bayonet scabbards. _The sword belt is required by the end of the first year._
[Soldier's Sword Belt][10]

**Le Gargoussier (Cartridge Box):** The waist mounted cartridge box was russet brown with the flap trimmed in buff leather cut in a sawtooth pattern and a buff anchor sewn on the center of the flap. The box had a wooden block which was bored for nine rounds of ammunition. The box is mounted on the sword belt on the right hip toward the front.

**Le Bayonet (Bayonet):** Bayonets of the correct period are recommended but not required. Socket bayonets were used on the military muskets, while plug bayonets were used with the trade fusils which did not have bayonet lugs.
[Veteran Arms will include a bayonet - $60][9]

**Le Casse-tete (Tomahawk):** Bayonets of the correct period are recommended but not required. Socket bayonets were used on the military muskets, while plug bayonets were used with the trade fusils which did not have bayonet lugs. Socket bayonets replaced plug bayonets in 1716.

> "I have therefore judged that the tomahawk, which is a small hand ax, would be in every way more suitable, inasmuch as it is a good weapon for defense and is very useful to the soldier, both to cut the stakes for his hut-shelter and his firewood and to open the trail in many circumstances or to build a boat in other urgent cases or finally to undermine the posts of an entrenchment that they might wish to force."
Governor Kerlerec to De Machault d Arnouville - Incident with the Chickasaws - September 15, 1754
Mississippi Provincial Archives Vol. V : French Dominion, 1749-1763 pg. 148

**L'Epee du Soldat (Sword):** The soldier was generally issued a sword. The rigors of moving through the bush caused the sword to be replaced with the tomahawk or axe in the field. For our portrayal, swords are not required. For a person of the rank of sergeant or above, the sword is highly recommended.

**Powder Horn:** A powder horn would have been issued to Marines, with its own narrow buff shoulder belt.

**Haversac Ordinare (Haversack):** The French knapsacks were four feet long and two feet, six inches wide, and folded in half, being tied with a thong or rope to hold them closed. They were mounted on a wide buff or russian leather strap which was slung over the right shoulder to hang in the back. They were made of heavy linen canvas.

**Couteau (Knife):** The marine most commonly carried a couteau jambette (clasp knife), though belt knives were not uncommon. Keep the knives in the proper mid-18th century style.
[Ken Hamilton makes museum quality French knives][12]

**Couverture (Blanket):** One or two solid-color wool blankets (blue, red, brown, green and white are best)

**Misc. Equipment:** In the cartridge box (or haversack or shot pouch) there should be the tools and accouterments and extra flints to maintain your musket during a battle, including a vent pick, screwdriver, and brush.

**La Tente (Tent):** The standard military tent is the wedge tent. The French Model 1750 measures 8"x8'6"x7' with a bell at the rear. (Fort Toulouse will provide some tents.)


In addition to the clothing and equipment listed above, you'll definitely need a period cup, eating utensils, and a plate and/or a bowl. Also a good idea are an oil lamp, a period bottle, and one or two solid-color wool blankets (blue, red, brown, green and white are best). These items aren't required, but are recommended, and can all be acquired over the course of the first year or two of participation.
