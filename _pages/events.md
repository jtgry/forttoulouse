In response to public health recommendations regarding the COVID-19, Fort Toulouse-Fort Jackson Park will closing the park campground on Sunday, March 15. Our primary concern is the health and safety of our staff, guests, and community. We look forward to reopening the campground at a later date.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Park grounds will remain open! We invite you to come and enjoy the beautiful 160 acre space. Take a walk in nature, enjoy the fresh air, and feel welcome at our historic site.

Here at Fort Toulouse - Fort Jackson Park, we host many events throughout the year. Along with our monthly living history events, you can experience the French and Indian War Encampment in April. Each November, we also host Alabama Frontier Days, which is one of the largest living history events in the state!
