**The living history program scheduled for Saturday, 21 September, is canceled due to reroofing of the Fort Toulouse barracks.**

Here at Fort Toulouse - Fort Jackson Park, we host many events throughout the year. Along with our monthly living history events, you can experience the French and Indian War Encampment in April. Each November, we also host Alabama Frontier Days, which is one of the largest living history events in the state!
