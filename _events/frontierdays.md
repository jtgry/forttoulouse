Experience one of the largest and most authentic living history events in Alabama! See the south as it transitioned from Creek Indian lands to military forts and civilian homesteads during the period 1700 to 1820. Using Fort Toulouse - Fort Jackson Park as its historical backdrop, Alabama Frontier Days focuses on demonstrating life on the southern frontier during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The public can experience this "living history" as many frontier crafts and trades are demonstrated by specialists dressed in historic costume. Frontier Days illustrates how people from this fascinating period of Alabama’s past lived and worked. This snapshot of frontier life includes Creek Indians, French soldiers and their families, British traders who lived among the Creeks and American soldiers who fought in Andrew Jackson’s army during the Creek War. Additionally, there will be strolling balladeers, entertainers, period musicians and a magician as well as merchants selling quality reproductions of items used on the frontier.
