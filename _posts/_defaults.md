We value Christ above honor and riches. This Pearl
of Great Price lies nearest our heart. He who prizes
Christ esteems the gleanings of Christ—better than
the world's vintage. He counts the worst things of
Christ—better than the best things of the world.
Moses "regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ
as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt."
Hebrews 11:26

If we are the prizers of Christ, we cannot live without
Him. A man may live without music, but not without food.
A child of God can lack health and friends—but he cannot
lack Christ. "Give me children," said Rachel, "or else I die!"
Genesis 30:1. So the soul says, "Give me Christ—or else I
shall die! Give me one drop of the water of life to quench
my thirst."

If we are prizers of Christ, then we shall not complain at
any pains to get Him. He who prizes gold, will dig for it in
the mine. "My soul follows hard after God!" Psalm 63:8.
He in whose eye Christ is precious, never rests until he
has gained Him: "I sought Him whom my soul loves; I
held Him, and would not let Him go!" Canticles 3:1,4

If we are prizers of Christ, then we take great pleasure
in Christ. What joy a man takes, in that which he counts
his treasure! He who prizes Christ makes Him his greatest
joy. He can delight in Christ, when earthly delights are gone.
Though a flower in a man's garden dies, he can still delight
in his money and jewels. He who esteems Christ, can solace
himself in Christ, when there is a dearth of all other comforts.
