As of Thursday, March 19, the Alabama Historical Commission will act on the recommendations of public health officials and Governor Ivey to implement a plan for social distancing in response to coronavirus and COVID-19. In the interest of public health and safety, the Alabama Historical Commission's main office and select historic sites have been closed to the public since March 16, and all events and programs are cancelled until April 30. The agency will reevaluate by that time. This closure includes the visitors' center and campgrounds at Fort Toulouse-Fort Jackson. Please note the grounds are accessible and open to the public at this time. Admission can be collected via honor box at the gate. We apologize for any inconvenience and look forward to seeing you on another occasion. 

In response to public health recommendations regarding the COVID-19, Fort Toulouse-Fort Jackson Park will closing the park campground on Sunday, March 15. Our primary concern is the health and safety of our staff, guests, and community. We look forward to reopening the campground at a later date.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Park grounds will remain open! We invite you to come and enjoy the beautiful 160 acre space. Take a walk in nature, enjoy the fresh air, and feel welcome at our historic site.
