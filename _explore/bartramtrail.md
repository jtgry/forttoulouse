The one mile long Bartram Nature Trail winds along ridge lines and river bottoms at the southern end of the park. Of particular not along its path is a marker dedicated to Sargeant Jean Louis Fontenot who served at Fort Toulouse from 1735 to 1754. Next you will see a cemetary just off the trail to your left. Only one marker remains, that of Isaac Ross. The cemetary is privately owned but open to public viewing; however, it must be treated with respect. There is also a marker dedicated to William Bartram, the famous naturalist who passed through this area in 1775, further down the trail.

The nature trail offers wonderful bird watching opportunities. During the spring and fall, migrants are present thought out the site. During the winter months, spotting the Fox Sparrow and Rusty Blackbird is simple, as well as the common Chipping, Song, Savannah, Field, and White-throated Sparrow plus the Dark-eyed Junco. Also present during the winter are the Hermit Thrush, Blue-headed Vireo and the Yellow-belled sapsucker woodpecker. The summer months bring out the petite Northern Parula, and the Summer Tanager, add to that the many breeding Acadian Flycatchers and Fort Toulouse is a bird watcher's year-round place to visit.
